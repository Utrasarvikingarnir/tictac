The first thing you have to do before start using the program is run "sh ./bin/Pandoc".
Next you call the master script by running the following command "sh ./bin/Master_Build".
The Master_Build script creates jar file, creates a documentation page and deploys the project.

After running the Master_Build script you run the "sh ./bin/Run" command, then you can play Tic Tac Toe.

The instructions on how to play the Tic Tac Toe game are listed when you run the program.
